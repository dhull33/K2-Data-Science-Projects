Welcome to the Thunderdome! 
A basic terminal game using object oriented programming to do a whole lot of nonsense. That is, if you think battling goblins and zombies is nonsense. Of course for us less sophiscated creatures, battling zombies and goblins is sure to be the height of our day. So you may love it and hail it as the best terminal game ever created. Or perhaps you'll put your fist through the computer screen and vow to never touch another keyboard. Either way, I am extremely grateful you thought this game worth your time to play. Please do not hesititate to tell me what you did and did not like as well as potential improvements. 

In order to play, just run the file called 'rpg_game.py' and follow the directions on the screen!
